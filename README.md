# Stochastic-Control-Based-Pair-Trading
This repository contains the code for implementing a Pair Trading strategy based on the principles of stochastic optimal control. Pair Trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that matches a long position with a short position in a pair of highly correlated instruments such as two stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), currencies, commodities or options.

Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a practical implementation of a pair trading strategy which can be used to identify trading opportunities and generate profitable trades.

The project employs several key metrics such as log returns, geometric returns, Sharpe ratio, standard deviation of returns, and holding days to evaluate the strategy's performance.
